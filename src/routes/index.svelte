<h3 class="text-2xl mb-3">Welcome to Medium Mashup!</h3>
<p class="mb-3">
	Medium Mashup is an Innovation Game where you invent a new tool to solve a specific persona's
	problem using randomly selected mediums and notations. The purpose of Medium Mashup is to help you
	move beyond features of a software tool to the underlying Mediums and Notations. Medium Mashup is
	an Innovation Game where you invent a new tool to solve a specific persona's problem using
	randomly selected Mediums and Notations.

<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">The Setup</h2>
<p class="mb-3">
	You're a toolsmith. You specialize in building bespoke tools for specialized use cases with
	arbitrary constraints. You operate as a team under tight timelines, and you (almost) always
	deliver. I hope you're up for today's challenge!
</p>
<ol class="mb-3 list-decimal pl-10">
	<li>
		<strong>Gather materials.</strong> You'll need the typical paper prototyping materials: unlined and
		grid paper, multi-colored sharpies, sticky notes, scissors, tape, highlighters, rulers.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Form a team.</strong> We recommend a team of 3-5 persons.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Discover the constraints.</strong> Draw 3 Medium and/or Notation cards from the Constraints
		deck. If you want to make it a bit easier, draw 4 cards and discard 1.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Get to know the client.</strong> Draw a Persona card. Read their background.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Choose a Workflow Goal.</strong> Read the client's Workflow Goals aloud together and discuss.
		Choose one of the Workflow Goals that your team will build a tool for.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Start building!</strong> You and your team have 90 minutes to design a new Tool that satisfies
		one of your Client's Workflow Goals while utilizing all of the Constraints.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Present the solution.</strong> Give a brief (5-10 minutes?) presentation walking through
		the tool that your team came up with. Describe the workflow in detail.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">Advice for Presenting The Solution</h2>
<p class="mb-3">Here are some questions you might want to answer:</p>
<ul class="mb-3 pl-10 list-disc">
	<li>What did you choose to include and why?</li>
	<li>What did you leave out?</li>
	<li>
		What did you learn about the interactions of the constraints you were given (the mediums and/or
		notations)?
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">The Constraint Deck</h2>
<p class="mb-3">
	The Constraint deck consists of Mediums and Notations that must be used in the tool you design for
	the Client.
</p>

<ul class="mb-3 pl-10 list-disc">
	{#each constraints as constraint}
		<li>
			<span
				><a class="border-b-2 border-slate-300 hover:border-slate-700" href={constraint.path}

	<li><span>More coming soon...</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">The Persona Deck</h2>
<p class="mb-3">
	The Persona deck consists of clients with specific Workflow Goals that you must build a tool for.
