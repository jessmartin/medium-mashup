# Medium Mashup

[Medium Mashup](https://mediums.jessmart.in) is an Innovation Game where you invent a new tool to solve a specific person's problem using randomly selected mediums and notations. The purpose of medium mashup is to help you move beyond features of a software tool to the underlying mediums and notations.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
